# "Orphaned" Oil and Gas Wells in the US

**Over 100,000** oil and gas wells in the US have been drilled and abandoned.

USGS defines these wells with four criteria:

1. no production (for the last 6-24 months, depending on the state)
2. unplugged
3. no one is responsible for using or plugging it
4. known location
