### "Orphaned" Oil and Gas Wells in the US

**Over 100,000** oil and gas wells in the US have been drilled and abandoned.

USGS defines these wells with four criteria:

1. no production (for the last 6-24 months, depending on the state)
2. unplugged
3. no one is responsible for using or plugging it
4. known location

My goal: learn to plot point data like these over e.g. census tracts, school locations, etc.

### Crop Classification via Remote Sensing

#### The Problem: 

* Knowing what crops grow where informs economic, water, labor, and health planning.

* But often, there is no documentation of what crops are actually growing.

#### The Solution:

* Recently, scholars have found ways to classify crop types through satellite data.

* This example source focuses on crops adjacent to the Aral Sea, mostly in Uzbekistan.

* The .zip file contians both array-type data (.rds, .csv) and geospatial data (shapefile)

My goal: learn how to visualize geospatial data formats, e.g. color polygons by crop type, and perform statistics (e.g. x% of the land is...)
